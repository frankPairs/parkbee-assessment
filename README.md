# ParkBee Developer Assessment

We'd like to thank you for taking the time to do our developer assessment. It consists of a [coding test](#coding-test) and some [technical questions](#technical-questions).

## Completed assessment

In order for us to review your completed assessment, please put your answers to the technical questions in the [technical.md](technical.md) file and ensure that your completed coding test is in a single folder. Compress the folder to a zip file and place it on a shared Google Drive folder, DropBox folder or similar and send the link to your recruiter or ParkBee employee who assigned you the test.

## Coding test

At ParkBee, we want to be able to operate a garage without using an App.

Your task is to create an front-end, that allows a user to view the avaiability of a location, start a parking action and stop a parking action.

You are free to use any or no UI framework. You can pick the tools you see fit.

### API

You can mock the parkbee API to retreive the information you need, and to start/stop the parking actions.
The methods we support can be found here https://developers.parkbee.net

### End result

The following pages should be visible available for a use :

- a garage overview that shows the price and availability
- a screen to start your parking action
- a screen to view your running parking action
- a screen to show the parking has been completed.

## User stories

As a **potential customer**  
I want to **view my garage details and all the doors for the garage**  
So that **I can decide if i want to start parking**

#### Acceptance criteria

- See details of the supplied garage only.
- Availability is displayed.
- Garage meta data is displayed
- Price is displayed

As a **potential customer**  
I want to **be able to start a parking action**  
So that **I can get into the location**

#### Acceptance criteria

- Once the parking action has been started succesfully the user should be able to see how long they are parking.

As a **customer**  
I want to **be able to stop a parking action**  
So that **I can get out the location**

#### Acceptance criteria

- It should be visible that the parking action is no longer running

### Added awesomeness

We would like to get a feel for how you would code on a day-to-day basis. Therefore consider the following:

- Add (or don't add) comments, documentation, logging, etc.
- Apply your code style.
- Add (or don't add) tests

## Technical questions

Please put answers to the following questions in the [technical.md](technical.md) file before adding it to the final zip file:

1. What architectures or patterns are you using currently or have worked on recently?
2. What do you think of them and would you want to implement it again?
3. What version control system do you use or prefer?
4. What is your favorite language feature and can you give a short snippet on how you use it?
5. What future or current technology do you look forward to the most or want to use and why?
6. How would you find a production bug/performance issue? Have you done this before?
7. How would you improve the application (bug fixes, security, performance, etc.)?

We thank you for your time in completing this assessment. If you have questions or comments, please forward them to the person who assigned you the assessment.
